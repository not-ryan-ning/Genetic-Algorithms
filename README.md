# Genetic Algorithms
**Personal Learning/Exploration Project**

This repository contains my personal **implementations** of various genetic algorithm selection methods in `Java`, including:
- **Ordered Crossover**
- **Partially Mapped Crossover**
- **Stochastic Universal Sampling**
- **Tournament Selection**
- **Truncation Selection**
- **Mutation Rates**

### Running the Program 
Download the files and run **`GeneticSelection.java`**.

Within the file, there are various methods that can be used to demonstrate each selection method.

### Note
This repository will be updated with new implementations as I continue learning more about genetic algorithms!
